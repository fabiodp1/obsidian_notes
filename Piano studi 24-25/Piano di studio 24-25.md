Here's an integrated day-by-day learning plan with added suggestions and time allocations. I've incorporated Git/GitHub, SQL, project-building, API documentation with Postman, and data structures. Since you’re already using TypeScript, we’ll skip it and focus more on rounding out your skills in cloud, backend, and testing.
